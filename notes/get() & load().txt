==============================// Get & Load //========================
get() is a method present in sessionFactor interface
with the help of this method we can get the data from database. shown in GetData.java class

load() also works the same way get() works

Difference between get() & load()

1.
get() method of Hibernate session returns null if data is not found in cache as well as on database.
load() method of Hibernate session throws ObjectNotFoundException if object is not found on cache as well as on database but never returns null.

2.
get(), involves database hit if object does not exists in Hibernate session memory and returns a fully initialized object which may involve several
database call.

load(), on the other hand can only return proxy in place and only initialize the object or hit the database if any method other than getId() is called on 
persistant or entity object. This lazy initiallization increases the performance.

3. 
get(), use it only when you are not sure that object exists in db or not.
load(), use if you are sure that object exists
