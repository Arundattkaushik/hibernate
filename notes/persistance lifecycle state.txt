Hibernate lifecycle means the states of object which occur 
when an object is saved by hibernate into the database.

There are following 4 stages which occur.
1. Transient State
2. Persistent State
3. Detached State
4. Removed State 

 Transient State::
 An object is said to be in a Transient state when it is 
 created and fully initialized.
 
 Example: Student s = new Student(1, "Ram");
 Now 's' is in Transient state.
 
 An object's transient state also means that this object is 
 not attached to session yet.
 
 Persistent State::
 Once we try to save this object with the help of session
 it means this object is now in 'Persistent state" under this 
 state this object is attached with session and also session saves this
 object in DB which means it also persists in DB.
 *Note: If we make any changes in the object/data's property under
 persistent state, then this makes in both session object and in DB(table) after commit.
 
 
Detached State::
Once we call session.close()/clear() means we detach the object from
persistent state and now object is in a new state called detached state.

 Now your object is not associated with session but the same object with old value lies in DB.
 
 
 Removed State::
 Once we call session.delete() it means we deleted the data from DB but it is still 
 associated with session object.
