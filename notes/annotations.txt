@Entity - used to mark any class as Entity

@Table - used to change the table details

@Id - used to mark column as id(primary key)

@GeneratedValue - it is used with @Id annotation and it will automatically generate
values for that using as internal sequence. Therefore we don't have to set it manually.

@Column - can be used to specify column mapping. For example, to change the column name
in the associated table in database. In short a column will be formed in the table with 
the name as mentioned in the braces of @Column.

@Transient - This tells hibernate not to save this field

@Temporal - @Temporal over a date field tells hibernate the format in the date needs to
be saved.

@Lob - @Lob over a field tells hibernate that this is a large object not a simple object.

@JoinColumn - @JoinColumn is used to rename/set a column name which is a forgin key for other table as @Column annotation can not be used here
