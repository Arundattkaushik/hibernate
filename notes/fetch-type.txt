There are two types of fetch type, eager & lazy namely.

Lazy Loading:-
In lazy loading, associated data loads only when we explicitly call the getter 
or setter method

Eager Loading:-
It is a design pattern in which data loading occurs on the spot

Example:- Let's say we have a question which is associated with N number of answers then

In case of Lazy loading:- if we load the question then answers will not load until we explicitly
call the getter method. Means only question will be loaded.

But 
In case of Eager loading:- if we load the question then all the answers associated to it will be loaded 
at the time of loading we don't need to call getter method of question explicitly.
